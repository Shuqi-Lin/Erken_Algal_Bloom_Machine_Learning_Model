# Erken_Algal_Bloom_Machine_Learning_Model
## The data used in 'Prediction of algal blooms via data-driven machine learning models: An evaluation using data from a well monitored mesotrophic lake' paper were stored in 'Training data' folder.

## All the models were written in PYTHON in Jupyter notebook. 

  ### Code 'DD models_Observation only_process-based model data' is for workflow 1
  ### Code 'DD models_two-step GBR model' and 'DD models_two-step LSTM model' are for workflow 2 and 3, the training features can be modified in the code.
  ### Code 'Sample sparsity test_GBR_4yr' and 'Sample sparsity test_LSTM_4yr' are for shuffling years data sparsity test
  ### Code '2019-2020 test' is for shuffling training years to test 2019-2020
 
## The all the model results are stored in 'Work record' folder
